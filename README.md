# MachineLearning
In this repository,a basic overview of Data Analysis and Data Visualization libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborne along with machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow is provided.

<h3>Numpy</h3> NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

<h3>Pandas</h3> Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

<h3>Matplotlib</h3> Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

<h3>Seaborn</h3> Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

<h3>Scikit-Learn</h3> Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN.

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
